# Registry

The ERC-6551 registry is responsible for calculating account addresses for each ERC-721 token, as well as deploying the account at that address.

The full source code of the ERC-6551 registry can be found in the [reference implementation](https://github.com/erc6551/reference/blob/main/src/ERC6551Registry.sol).

## What is ERC-6551?

ERC-6551 is proposed system of smart contracts that gives every NFT it's own wallet address. This allows all NFTs to own assets, interact with applications, and participate as sovereign agents in the Ethereum ecosystem.

ERC-6551 is unique in it's approach because it requires zero changes to existing NFT smart contracts or infrastructure.

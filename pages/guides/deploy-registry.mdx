# Deploy Registry Contract

<Callout emoji="👉" type="info">
  This guide covers the deployment of the ERC-6551 Registry contract for the
  purpose of interacting with TBAs (Tokenbound Accounts) on a local node OR if
  you want to enable TBAs for the first time on a new EVM chain. Otherwise, you
  may use the existing canonical ERC-6551 Registry contract.
</Callout>

The ERC-6551 Registry contract has already been deployed across several EVM networks. A list of deployed addresses can be found [here](/contracts/deployments).

### Pre-Requisites

- foundry

  If you do not have foundry already:

  ```bash
  $ curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
  ```

  ```bash
  $ foundryup
  ```

- terminal

<Steps>
### Clone the Reference repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/erc6551/reference.git
```

<Callout emoji="❗" type="error">
Make sure you checkout on `v0.2.0` tag for the repository

This is ensures that the address of Registry contract is the same as on any other EVM compatible chain. The current address that’s deployed on all chains is: `0x02101dfB77FDE026414827Fdc604ddAF224F0921`

</Callout>

```bash
$ git checkout tags/v0.2.0
```

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">

If this address differs it would cause a tokenbound account associated with an NFT to have different addresses on different chains (we do not want that)

</Callout>

### Run the test and build the contracts

```bash
$ forge test
```

```bash
$ forge build
```

### Compute the Registry address

This is to make sure it matches with `0x02101dfB77FDE026414827Fdc604ddAF224F0921`

```bash
$ forge script script/ComputeRegistryAddress.s.sol:ComputeRegistryAddress
```

The output should be:

<Callout emoji="👉" type="info">
  make sure the Address matches with
  `0x02101dfB77FDE026414827Fdc604ddAF224F0921`
</Callout>
```bash ❯ forge script script/ComputeRegistryAddress.s.sol:ComputeRegistryAddress
[⠒] Compiling... No files changed, compilation skipped Script ran successfully. Gas

### Deploy
Before we can deploy we need to provide `MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY` env variable - set this to your test account’s private key

<Tabs items={["on any EVM compatible chain", "on Local node"]}>
<Tab>
```bash
$ forge script --fork-url <RPC_URL> script/DeployRegistry.s.sol --broadcast
````

replace `<RPC_URL>` with your chain's RPC endpoint

</Tab>
<Tab>
In another terminal run anvil (anvil is just a local testnet node that is included in foundry)
```bash
$ anvil
```
The registry requires a `CREATE2` deployer contract to be present on the chain before deployment. Since it’s a fresh chain we’d have to deploy it ourselves. (you won’t have to do it on Ethereum or any of its testnets)

With `anvil` we can set a bytecode on a particular address:

```bash
cast rpc anvil_setCode 0x4e59b44847b379578588920ca78fbf26c0b4956c 0x7fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe03601600081602082378035828234f58015156039578182fd5b8082525050506014600cf3
```

and now we can run the deploy script:

```bash
forge script --fork-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 script/DeployRegistry.s.sol --broadcast
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>
### You may now use the address of the deployed ERC-6551 Registry contract to read the address of and deploy Tokenbound Accounts.

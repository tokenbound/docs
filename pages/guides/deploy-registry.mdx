# Deploy Registry Contract

Registry contract is supposed to be deployed once for a particular Chain. It has been deployed a bunch of chains already, see deployed addresses [here](/contracts/deployments).

<Callout emoji="üëâ" type="info">
You would only need to deploy the Registry contract if you're spinning up a test blockchain and trying to interact with TBAs (Tokenbound Accounts) on the local node OR if you want to enable TBAs for your new EVM chain.
</Callout>

### Pre-Requisites

- foundry

    If you do not have foundry already:

    ```bash
    $ curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    ```
    ```bash
    $ foundryup
    ```

- terminal

<Steps>
### Clone the Reference repository

```bash
$ gh repo clone erc6551/reference
```



<Callout emoji="‚ùó" type="error">
Make sure you checkout on `v0.2.0` tag for the repository

This is important because you wanna make sure that the address of Registry contract is the same as on any other EVM compatible chain. The current address that‚Äôs deployed on all chains is: `0x02101dfB77FDE026414827Fdc604ddAF224F0921`
</Callout>

```bash
$ git checkout tags/v0.2.0
```

<Callout emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è" type="warning">

If this address differs it would cause a tokenbound account associated with an NFT to have different addresses on different chains (we do not want that)
</Callout>

### Run the test and build the contracts
```bash
$ forge test
```
```bash
$ forge build
```

### Compute the Registry address
This is to make sure it matches with `0x02101dfB77FDE026414827Fdc604ddAF224F0921`
```bash
$ forge script script/ComputeRegistryAddress.s.sol:ComputeRegistryAddress
```

The output should be:
<Callout emoji="üëâ" type="info">
make sure the Address matches with `0x02101dfB77FDE026414827Fdc604ddAF224F0921`
</Callout>
```bash
‚ùØ forge script script/ComputeRegistryAddress.s.sol:ComputeRegistryAddress

```
### Deploy
Before we can deploy we need to provide `MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY` env variable - set this to your test account‚Äôs private key

<Tabs items={["on any EVM compatible chain", "on Local node"]}>
<Tab>
```bash
$ forge script --fork-url <RPC_URL> script/DeployRegistry.s.sol --broadcast
```
replace `<RPC_URL>` with your chain's RPC endpoint
</Tab>
<Tab>
In another terminal run anvil (anvil is just a local testnet node that is included in foundry)
```bash
$ anvil
```
The registry requires a `CREATE2` deployer contract to be present on the chain before deployment. Since it‚Äôs a fresh chain we‚Äôd have to deploy it ourselves. (you won‚Äôt have to do it on Ethereum or any of its testnets)

With `anvil` we can set a bytecode on a particular address:
```bash
cast rpc anvil_setCode 0x4e59b44847b379578588920ca78fbf26c0b4956c 0x7fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe03601600081602082378035828234f58015156039578182fd5b8082525050506014600cf3
```

and now we can run the deploy script:
```bash
forge script --fork-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 script/DeployRegistry.s.sol --broadcast
```

# Custom Accounts

It is possible to implement your own custom implementation of an [account](/contracts/account) and make the SDK point to your custom implementation instead of the default implementation.

To achieve that, you can optionally pass custom configuration parameters when instantiating your TokenboundClient:

```javascript
import { TokenboundClient } from "@tokenbound/sdk";

const tokenboundClient = new TokenboundClient({
  signer: "<signer>",
  chainId: "<chainId>",
  implementationAddress: "<custom_implementation_address>",
});

// Custom implementation AND custom registry (uncommon for most implementations)
const tokenboundClientWithCustomRegistry = new TokenboundClient({
  signer: "<signer>",
  chainId: "<chainId>",
  implementationAddress: "<custom_implementation_address>",
  registryAddress: "<custom_registry_address>",
});
```

If, for any reason, you need to override the custom implementation on the client instance, you can:

1. Create another instance of TokenboundClient OR
2. Override `implementationAddress` or `registryAddress` directly when calling `getAccount`,
   `prepareCreateAccount`, `createAccount`, or `computeAccount`:

```javascript
const result = tokenboundClient.getAccount({
  tokenContract: "<token_contract_address>",
  tokenId: "<token_id>",
  implementationAddress: "<custom_implementation_address>",
  registryAddress: "<custom_registry_address>",
});
```

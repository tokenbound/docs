# Installation

The Tokenbound SDK is compatible with viem and Ethers. Install the correct version of the SDK based on the library you are using in your application.

Note: If making use of one of the many Web3 starter kits, please make sure that you're using a recent release of viem (>1.0), Ethers 5.7+, or 6 to avoid issues.
